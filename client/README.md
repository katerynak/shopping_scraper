A client application based on `flask`.

The app is composed of a simple search page, where the user can insert the 
search term, and a results page, where the crawler results are displayed in a
table. The user can sort the results by name, price or unit price.

Module organization:
  - `main.py`: the main flask app where the endpoints are defined
  - `static/`: style + images
  - `templates/`: html/js page templates
